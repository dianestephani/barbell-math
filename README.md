# Barbell Math Machine
### The fitness solution that no one asked for!

The Barbell Math Machine was created with both coaches and clients in mind. The user enters the target weight they're trying to lift, their total volume, and their expected RPE, and the machine calculates their optimal warm-up sets.

Stretch goal: logic that tells the user exactly how many of which size bumper plates to use.
